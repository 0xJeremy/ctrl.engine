# Machine Vision using Tensorflow

This submodule provides an interface to do high-level machine vision using Tensorflow with a Coral.ai EdgeTPU chip.

### Currently Implemented:
- [x] Face Detection (with bounding box and confidence)
- [x] Object Detection (with bounding box and confidence)
- [x] Image Classiifcation (with confidence)
- [x] Pose Detection (with vertices and confidence)

### Models Available:
#### Face Detection:  
+ MobileNet V2
#### Object Detection:
